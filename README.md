#### Scripts for the preprint `Alevin-fry-atac enables rapid and memory frugal mapping of single-cell ATAC-seq data using virtual colors for accurate genomic pseudoalignment`

We provide snakefiles to reproduce the results in the paper. The individual software and the data have to be downloaded in order to run the workflow. We have however provided the link to both the software and dataset, in both the manuscript and in this repository. `config.yml` has to be updated accordingly with the right path of the software and output paths. The parameters are self-explanatory.

If you face any issues, please reach out to `npsingh@umd.edu` or create a GitHub Issue.
